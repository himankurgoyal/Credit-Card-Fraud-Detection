# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
As there is an enormous advancement in E-commerce and Online banking, use of Credit Cards has grown up leading to a large number of fraud incidents. 
This has caused huge economic loss. An effective Credit Card Fraud Detection model is essential to maintain the reliability of the payment system. In this, 
we have projected an innovative approach towards credit card fraud detection and some other alternative techniques that have been used in fraud detection.

  My aim is to develop a Credit Card Fraud Detection system that is well defined to detect the fraud on the basis of transactions which are made. It is
  basically a supervised learning which involves prediction. Many modern techniques based on machine learning such as Isolation Forest Algorithm, 
  Back propagation neural network, Fuzzy Logic(Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System), K-means clustering,Fuzzy C-means clustering have evolved in detecting 
  various credit card fraudulent transactions. From this study we want to develop an efficient model to detect the fraud cases.
